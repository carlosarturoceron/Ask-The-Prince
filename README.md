# Ask The Prince - AI Conversations with Machiavelli's Wisdom ðŸ¦œðŸ”—ðŸ¤–ðŸ“–

Welcome to Ask The Prince, a fascinating project that blends classical literature with state-of-the-art AI technology. With this repository, you can engage in thought-provoking conversations with NiccolÃ² Machiavelli's timeless classic, "The Prince," brought to life as an AI Language Model.

## Overview

Ask The Prince allows you to interact with the wisdom of "The Prince" in a conversational manner. This project utilizes OpenAI embeddings and similarity search to create a dynamic and context-aware conversation. As a user, you can ask questions or provide prompts as if you are seeking advice from Machiavelli himself.

## How It Works

We've harnessed the power of OpenAI embeddings to create a vector store from "The Prince." When you ask a question or provide a prompt, we perform a similarity search. The results of this search are then passed to the a [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Question-Answering chain as context, ensuring that the responses are in alignment with Machiavelli's philosophy.

## Features
